Work on Parallax's ActivityBot, as part of UCL COMP105P (Robotics Programming).

This script updates the CMakeList.txt file, to include all the C files in subdirectories of your CODE_FOLDER directory.
It then compiles your programs for the simulator.

Make executable : 
```
chmod +x update_list.sh
```
Usage : 
```
./update_list.sh -a SIMULATOR_APPS_FOLDER -d CODE_FOLDER
```
